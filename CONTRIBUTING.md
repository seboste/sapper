## How to contribute to Sapper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sapper!

> **_INFO:_** Please try to preserve Sapper's architecture and quality standards. Write unit tests whenever possible. Don't introduce new dependencies neither within sapper nor to 3rd party packages whenever possible. Always prefer the Go standard packages over 3rd party packages. Depend on abstractions (i.e. interfaces) in the core and not on concrete implementations (e.g. all conan related stuff should go into adapters so that it could be replaced/supplemented at some point).
